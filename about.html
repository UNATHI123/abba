<p3>Why our work important:
  <b>Illegal trade in exotic and endangered species is a problem of epic proportions:</b><br>
Only the drug and gun trades are larger in terms of their scope and profit throughout the world today.<br>
Just in South Africa, an 13000-30000 estimated large exotic animals live outside our zoos.<br>
  The Humane Society of Africa estimates that 10,000 to 15,000 big cats are in private hands, from cages in basements to roadside zoos-- most of them in squalid and inhumane conditions.
